# Contributing to the H1N1 & Seasonal Flu Vaccine Prediction Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! Our goal is to build robust and ethical machine learning models that help predict vaccination behavior based on the 2009 National H1N1 Flu Survey. This could guide future public health decisions and vaccine outreach strategies.

This document outlines how you can contribute to the project, whether by raising issues, improving code, refining documentation, or enhancing the analysis.

## Project Overview
This project is based on a binary classification task: predicting either H1N1 or seasonal flu vaccination uptake. For the purpose of a minimum viable product (MVP), contributors should focus on only one of these targets.

The dataset used is publicly available and was part of a competition running until March 31, 2022.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues or Suggesting Features
If you notice any problems with the data, code, documentation, or modeling approaches:

* Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/your-repo/issues)

* Clearly describe the problem or suggestion

* Provide context or code snippets where applicable

* Use screenshots for data visualization-related issues if needed

### 2. Submitting Code via Pull Requests (PRs)

If you want to fix a bug, refactor code, or add new functionality:

**Typical Workflow:**

* Fork the repository

* Create a new branch (feature/your-feature-name or fix/your-bug-name)

* Make your changes (write clear, descriptive commit messages)

* Test your changes

* Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request (PR) to the main branch

### Guidelines:

* Follow PEP8 for Python code

* Include comments for complex logic

* Add or update documentation where needed

* Include evaluation metrics and performance summaries when contributing model changes

If adding new features or models, clearly indicate which target (H1N1 or seasonal flu) is being predicted
